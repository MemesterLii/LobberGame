                    <div id="updateDetails">Text and images on the website are now fully responsive to every screen type. The unity game window is still unresponsive, though. Mole enemy completed. Mole starts above ground and digs underground when on screen. The mole then moves towards the player (it’s invisible) and once it gets close enough, it displays a digging animation (warns the player) and then digs out. If the mole hits the player, the player takes heavy damage.</div>
                    
                    <p id="updateDates">6-22-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Fixed knockback to have a fixed angle of knockback (trigonometry came in useful). Started working on mole enemy.</div>
                    
                    <p id="updateDates">6-21-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Added enemy health bars and health drops. Added contact damage with enemies and subsequent knockback that stuns the player. Added pause menu. Added dash mechanic to player movement.</div>
                    
                    <p id="updateDates">6-20-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Let the tortoise enemy move back and forth on its platform.</div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-19-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Finished tortoise enemy (tortoises can now shoot back at players when out of their shell). Added a start menu and a game over screen. Added player health loss and death. Added a basic tutorial. Added a player health bar. Cleaned up
                        the code in all the scripts.</div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-17-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Added bomb damage and the tortoise enemy’s defense mechanism (hiding in shell for a random interval; black color means the turtle is in its shell and cannot be hurt).</div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-16-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Successfully uploaded the webpage to the web under the url memesterlii.github.io (this was a prototype website, so the url may have changed by the time someone views this)! Made the web page more compatible with different screen sizes.
                        Fullscreen button now functioning. Added an explosion force when a bomb explodes, knocking nearby objects away. Allows for a bomb jump that boosts the player up. Added a throwing cooldown on the bombs so the player can’t bomb jump
                        forever.
                    </div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-15-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Created a small parallax scroll effect for the webpage. Added a sprite for the player. Bombs now rotate when thrown. Fixed sprites clipping with other objects. Added a basic enemy that can take damage (will serve as the framework for
                        future enemies). Successfully embedded unity game into the web page (chose no compression in the player settings).</div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-14-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Embedded an earlier build of the Unity game into the website. Unfortunately, it ran into an error. Something about not being hosted on an http web server?</div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-13-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Stopped trajectory line when a surface is hit. Added a custom cursor and an explosion icon at where the bomb is predicted to land. Created a hand-drawn sprite for the bomb.</div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-10-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Created a bomb trajectory line.</div>

                    <div id="updateDetails">Remade website looks. Unified “bomb” themes between the game and the website.</div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-8-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Added the main combat system to the game. The player can now click to throw a bomb that explodes upon impact. Actually filled in the update log with current progress. Spruced up the game website with a new color palette and a wave
                        transition (with SVG), courtesy of Haikei.</div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-7-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Created a basic layout for this website. Working update log created (what you're looking at now).

                    <div id="updateDetails">Updated camera control. Users can now pan the camera towards where the user moves the cursor. Camera location is also affected by the player's velocity.
                    </div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-3-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Changed the player's shape from a capsule to a rectangle. Added jumping! Took inspiration from Celeste and included “coyote” frames to jump timing, meaning you can still jump a few frames after you walk off an edge. Added “Mario” jump
                        mechanics (ie. you fall faster than you jump and the apex of your jump depends on how long you hold the spacebar).

                            <p>Bugs:</p>

                                <li>The player would stick to walls if they “walked” into them mid-air.</li>
                                <li>The player fell EXTREMELY slowly.</li>

                                <li>Adding a physics material to the player that had 0 friction prevented wall-sticking.</li>
                                <li>Changed setting vertical velocity of player to 0 every fixed update to setting the vertical velocity to itself, allowing gravity to work unhindered.</li>

                    <div id="updateDetails">Created a game website. Established a .html, .js, and a .css file. Linked both .js and .css to the .html file. Aiming to format the website in a way so I can embed the Unity game into it. Played around a bit with element ids, classes,
                        css styling, and buttons. Planned out website in Google Slides.</div>

                    <p id="updateDates">6-1-2022</p>
                    <div id="updateDetails">Opened a new Unity project, created the ground, two walls, and a capsule (player). Added Rigidbody2D (physics) and a hitbox for the player. Created a player script and added horizontal movement (using Rigidbody.MovePosition). Froze
                        player rotation. Added input to control horizontal movement (Using Input.GetAxisRaw). Created a camera script; camera now follows the player on both X- and Y-axes (Using Transform).</div>
